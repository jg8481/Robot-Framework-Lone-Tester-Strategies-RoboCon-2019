Documentation    In a hypothetical scenario, where you are split between 3 or more frequently changing projects. Maybe you were able to convince your team leaders and developers
...              to provide you with some help building out the Robot Framework regression tests. The following assumes that the team member helping you is most likely a developer.
...              The developer helping you is comfortable with contributing to a test that uses a few keywords from the standard Robot Framework BuiltIn Library, and the rest is
...              handled by a user-created library. In this case the library is written in Python...
