Documentation     Part Two of the Python Library example has been enhanced by using the SharedKeywordsAndListeners.robot resource file to add 2 types of Robot Framework listeners and a team notification keyword.
...               Also added the "--randomize all" option in the commands-running-inside-a-docker-container.sh script, and will demonstrate the use of the "--rerunfailedsuites".
